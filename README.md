# MARITIME_PORT_MANAGEMENT_APPLICATION
A console application to manage a port with container ships. In this application we are able to manage the creation and delivery of new containers. It is possible to create ships, load them, send them on a cruise and unload them to a transshipment wagon or to a warehouse. Unsafe containers are deleted after a certain period (depending on the type). All data is saved to a file and the stock is checked at all times. What is important is readable for the user (without serialization).
